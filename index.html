<br>I am a Computational Biologist at the HudsonAlpha Institude for Biotechnology <a href="https://gsc.hudsonalpha.org/">Genome Sequencing Center</a>
and physically located in Fort Collins, CO at Colorado State University. 
My projects contribute to the broader mission of <a href="https://www.green-evolution.org/home">Green Evolution</a>, 
where we work to leverage pangenomics for accelerating African dryland cereals. 
My research interests broadly include- investigating the mechanisms by which 
plant biodiversity arises, is maintained, and how it can be leveraged for 
conservation and agricultural improvement.<br><br> 

<br>I recived my PhD from Penn State University and was co-advised by Ruairidh Sawers and Jesse Lasky. 
My doctoral research used a combination of genomic, phenotypic, physiological, and environmental data 
to better understand local adaptation in crop landraces (native varieties). I received my B.S. in Botany 
with a minor in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation in 2019 from the University of Florida. While at UF, my 
research focused on development of <a href="https://www.provenwinners.com/plants/ocimum/pesto-besto-sweet-italian-basil-ocimum-hybrid/">sweet basil hybrids</a>
with downy mildew resistance, under the supervision of Dave Clark. I have also had the great pleasure of 
interning for the Smithsonian Gardensâ€™ orchid collection department. When not thinking about cereal crops, 
Iâ€™m likely hiking, botanizing, or mountain biking.<br><br>
