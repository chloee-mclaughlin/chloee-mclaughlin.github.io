<br>I am curently a Post-doctoral Researcher / Computational Biologist at the <a href="https://www.hudsonalpha.org/?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAACPIDCRpaufj82kFrQSVyESKvKbvw&gclid=CjwKCAjw8IfABhBXEiwAxRHlsBDgHQM1O1Dokl0ET_AyIvRWH3wrZzlv1tbgvVaqgj4di2YlycvzahoCLKgQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology</a> Genome Sequencing Center and physically located in Fort Collins, CO at Colorado State University. 
My projects contribute to the broader mission of <a href="https://www.green-evolution.org/home"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Green Evolution</a>, where we work to leverage pangenomics for accelerating African dryland cereals. I’m especially interested 
in how genomics and bioinformatic tools can help uncover the genetic basis of plant local adaptation and how this knowledge can inform efforts in both 
conservation and agricultiure. Most of my work focuses on cereal crop landraces (locally adapted varieties), but I’m excited by any system that allows for the
intersection of genetic diveristy, environment, and adaptation.<br><br>

<br>I recived my PhD from Penn State University in 2024 and was co-advised by <a href="https://jesserlasky.github.io/laskylab-web/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Jesse Lasky</a> and Ruairidh Sawers. My doctoral research used a combination of genomic, phenotypic, physiological, and environmental data to better 
understand local adaptation in cereal crop landraces (mainly sorghum and maize). I received my B.S. in Botany with a minor in 
Wildlife Ecology and Conservation in 2019 from the University of Florida. While at UF, my research focused on 
development of <a href="https://www.provenwinners.com/plants/ocimum/pesto-besto-sweet-italian-basil-ocimum-hybrid"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
sweet basil hybrids</a> with downy mildew resistance, under the supervision of Dave Clark. I have also had the great pleasure of interning for the 
Smithsonian Gardens’ orchid collection department. When not thinking about cereal crops, I’m likely hiking, botanizing, or mountain biking.<br><br>
