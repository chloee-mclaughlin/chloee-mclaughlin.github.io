      I am computational Biologist in John Lovell's Evolutionary Analysis team at the
      <a href="https://www.hudsonalpha.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology</a>
      Genome Sequencing Center, and am an affiliate of the
      <a href="https://www.green-evolution.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crop Adaptation Labs</a>
      at Colorado State University.
      My research aims to better understand how native ecotypes adapt to their local environments and use this information to improve the climate-resilience of crops and
      to make more informed conservation efforts.

      In 2024, I received my PhD in Plant Biology from Penn State University where I was co-advised by
      <a href="https://jesserlasky.github.io/laskylab-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse Lasky</a> and 
      <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XG2MgVgAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruairidh Sawers</a>.
      My doctoral research used a combination of genomic, phenotypic, physiological, and environmental data to better understand local adaptation
      in cereal crop landraces (e.g. sorghum and maize). I also have a B.S. in Botany with a minor in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation
      from the University of Florida. While at UF, I worked with Dave Clark and my research focused on development of
      <a href="https://www.provenwinners.com/plants/ocimum/pesto-besto-sweet-italian-basil-ocimum-hybrid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      sweet basil hybrids</a> with downy mildew resistance. 

      When not thinking about cereal crops, I’m likely hiking, botanizing, or skiing.
