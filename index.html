      I am currently a Post-doctoral Researcher / Computational Biologist in John Lovell's Evolutionary Analysis team at the
      <a href="https://www.hudsonalpha.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology</a>
      Genome Sequencing Center, and an affiliate of the
      <a href="https://www.green-evolution.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crop Adaptation Labs</a>
      at Colorado State University.
      My research aims to understand the genetic basis of plant local adaptation and apply this knowledge toward breeding climate-resilient crops and
      more informed conservation efforts. Most of my work so far has focused on crop landraces (locally adapted varieties), but I’m excited by any
      system that sheds light on the intersection of genetics, environment, and adaptation.

      I received my PhD from Penn State University in 2024 and was co-advised by
      <a href="https://jesserlasky.github.io/laskylab-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse Lasky</a> and Ruairidh Sawers.
      My doctoral research used a combination of genomic, phenotypic, physiological, and environmental data to better understand local adaptation
      in cereal crop landraces (mainly sorghum and maize). I received my B.S. in Botany with a minor in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation in 2019
      from the University of Florida. While at UF, my research focused on development of
      <a href="https://www.provenwinners.com/plants/ocimum/pesto-besto-sweet-italian-basil-ocimum-hybrid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      sweet basil hybrids</a> with downy mildew resistance, under the supervision of Dave Clark.
      I have also had the great pleasure of interning for the Smithsonian Gardens’ orchid collection department.
      When not thinking about cereal crops, I’m likely hiking, botanizing, or mountain biking.
