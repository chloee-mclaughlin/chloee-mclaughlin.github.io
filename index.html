<br>I am curently a Post-doctoral Researcher / Computational Biologist in John Lovell's Evolutionary Analysis team at the <a href="https://www.hudsonalpha.org/?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAACPIDCRpaufj82kFrQSVyESKvKbvw&gclid=CjwKCAjw8IfABhBXEiwAxRHlsBDgHQM1O1Dokl0ET_AyIvRWH3wrZzlv1tbgvVaqgj4di2YlycvzahoCLKgQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology</a> Genome Sequencing Center, and an affiliate of the <a href="https://www.green-evolution.org/home"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Crop Adaptation Labs</a>, at Colorado State University. My reseach aims to understand the genetic basis of plant local adaptation and works to apply this knowlege for breeding climate-resilient crops and
more informed conservation efforts. Most of my work so far has focused on crop landraces (locally adapted varieties), but I’m excited by any system that sheds light on the intersection of genetics, environment, and adaptation.<br><br>

<br>I recived my PhD from Penn State University in 2024 and was co-advised by <a href="https://jesserlasky.github.io/laskylab-web/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Jesse Lasky</a> and Ruairidh Sawers. My doctoral research used a combination of genomic, phenotypic, physiological, and environmental data to better 
understand local adaptation in cereal crop landraces (mainly sorghum and maize). I received my B.S. in Botany with a minor in 
Wildlife Ecology and Conservation in 2019 from the University of Florida. While at UF, my research focused on 
development of <a href="https://www.provenwinners.com/plants/ocimum/pesto-besto-sweet-italian-basil-ocimum-hybrid"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
sweet basil hybrids</a> with downy mildew resistance, under the supervision of Dave Clark. I have also had the great pleasure of interning for the 
Smithsonian Gardens’ orchid collection department. When not thinking about cereal crops, I’m likely hiking, botanizing, or mountain biking.<br><br>
