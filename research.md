<h3 style="text-align: center;">Identifying the environmental gradients and loci underlying local adaptation</h3>

Genotype-environment associations (GEAs) can be useful for identifying environmentally related loci, but it is often unclear which aspect(s) of the environment might drive selection.  
I have developed a method that predicts trait variation across the multivariate environment. Fitted models are then used with environmental data to project trait values onto a larger sample of available georeferenced genotypes and used in genome-wide association (GWA).

I have used this method to model adaptive variation described by environmental gradients and identify loci associated with landrace maize…

  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Modeling disruptions to adaptation and optimal migrations</h3>

  <p>
    Extreme and sudden changes to climate threaten traditional local crop populations adapted to historic climates.  
    However, the diversity present in crops may enhance agricultural resilience under changing conditions.
  </p>

  <p>Here, we develop a framework to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Characterize current crop genotype-environment relationships,</li>
    <li>Quantify maladaptation across space and time,</li>
    <li>Search for suitable varietal substitutions in the case of soot-induced climate change (e.g., nuclear winter).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We find that such catastrophic events would result in the global maladaptation of crop landraces, 
    and a suitable varietal substitution may not exist for many locations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our framework can be extended to understand the impacts of greenhouse gas–induced climate change 
    for plants adapted to historical local climates.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Trade-offs driven by host-parasite co-evolution</h3>

Striga hermonthica is a root parasitic plant and is a major constraint to cereal crop yields in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Certain ecotypes of sorghum have adapted resistance strategies in response to local parasite prevalence.  
Using physiological and high-throughput phenotyping, I work to identify trade-offs associated with host resistance strategies.
