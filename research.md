  <br>Identifying the environmental gradients and loci underlying local adaptation
Genotype-environment associations (GEAs) can be useful for identifying environmentally 
related loci, but it is often unclear which aspect(s) of the environment might drive 
selection. I have developed a method that predicts trait variation across the multivariate 
environment. Fitted models are then used with environmental data to project trait values onto 
a larger sample of available georeferenced genotypes and used in genome-wide association (GWA).<br><br>

<br>I have used this method to model adaptive variation described by environmental gradients and identify 
loci associated with landrace maizeâ€¦<br>
